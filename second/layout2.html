            JEFFERSONVILLE, Ind. (AP) â€” A man who authorities say was convicted in the 1998 shooting death of his teenage girlfriend in Utah and should've still been in jail has been arrested on suspicion of killing a woman inside a southern Indiana home.

            Jeffersonville police found the body of 46-year-old Tammy Jo Blanton on Thursday after a friend called worried about her welfare.

            Detective Todd Hollis told the News and Tribune she died from violence he wouldn't describe and that her body was found in a bathroom beneath a tarp. Police arrested Joseph Oberhansley, 33, on a preliminary charge of murder and he was jailed without bond.
