		ST. GEORGE â€” A man accused of holding hostages during an armed bank robbery is dead, police said.

Around 1:45 p.m., a robbery occurred at Zions Bank at 717 S. River Road, during which a robber took two hostages, police said. The robber escaped in a vehicle, taking the women with him, and police began a pursuit. Within a couple of minutes, the man stopped and exited the car, fleeing on foot into a wooded area. The hostages fled the vehicle at that point.

Around 4:20 p.m., Washington City officials said the threat had been "diffused," and police later said an officer-involved shooting had occurred.

Officials later said the man was dead.

No further information about the shooting was available as of 4:45 p.m.

During the pursuit, St. George police told residents between Washington Fields Road to 2000 South and Washington Deseret Industrial area to 1450 East in St. George to stay indoors and secure their doors.

At that time, more than a dozen schools in the area were on lockout status. After the threat had been diffused, police gave Washington County School District the go-ahead to release all students who had been held in school while the alleged robber was at-large.
